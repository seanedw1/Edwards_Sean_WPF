var myFunction= function(){


}










    /*
     function functionname(parameters){ -function definition/normal function can be invoked before defined

     //code the function runs
     blocks of code
     }


     function invocation/execution/function call

     functionname(arguments1,arguments2,);----making a function work/outside of curly braces-print to console


     procedure-a more specific type of function/they never return values/same as function without return

     variable scope-inside and outside function-functions use variables inside curly braces

     parameters-Function parameters are the names listed in the function definition.

     arguments-Function arguments are the real values received by the function when it is invoked.

     Inside the function, the arguments are used as local variables.

     returning-getting values back from a function


     calcArea(30-first parameter,20-second parameter);
     function calArea(w-first,h-second){ //w=30, h=20

     return calcArea;//function spitting the info out
     }

     var total=calcArea(30,20)-assigns function a output variable

     4 types
     sequential-expressions
     conditional-if statements ,ternaries
     reusable-dry-dont repeat yourself
     repetitive-

     variables-stores values
     functions-store blocks of code

     function types
     functions -normal functions
     precedures-

     anonymous functions-functions created as the code is run/also called closures/have to be declared before there called/define before invoking

     var functionName = function(){  -annonymous function
     code to run
     }

     functionName();-function call


     var calcArea = function(width,height){  -annonymous function
     code to run
     }

/*
A ternary
An else if
An anonymous function
A normal "named" function
An expression with two arithmetic operators
A function with three parameters.
At least one logical operator
*/

/* conditionals notes

 if(condition){actions-code runs if condition is true}

 else{ actions performed if condition is false-should never have condition attached to it
 ();}


 else if() {
 else if -choosing between three or more blocks of code-always require a condition-goes before and else


 }

 = assignment

 equality operators

 == equal to/equality/the same as
 === strict equality/the value and the same type is beter than ==
 != not equal to/inequality/is not the same as/uses the ! operator



 relational operators-comparing two variables or values/go between pairs of objects/always work in pairs

 the comparison results in true false

 > greater than
 < less than
 >=greater than or equal to
 <=less than or equal to

 logical operators-comparing pairs of true and false/between realational expressions or boolean values/always works in pairs

 the comparison results in true false
 they compare two true or false values
 they compare pairs of relational expressions

 && and -requires both in pair to be true for the whole pair to be true
 || or -requires at least one of the pair to be true for the whole pair to be true
 ! not -flips a value-true becomes false, false becomes true-is not used for comparison-if more than one are true the result is false
 ^ exclusive or (xor)

 ternaries-decision making on one line

 (condition)? do if true : do if false;
