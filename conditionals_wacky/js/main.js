/* conditionals notes

 if(condition){actions-code runs if condition is true}

 else{ actions performed if condition is false-should never have condition attached to it
 ();}


 else if() {
 else if -choosing between three or more blocks of code-always require a condition-goes before and else

 = assignment

 equality operators

 == equal to/equality/the same as
 === strict equality/the value and the same type is beter than ==
 != not equal to/inequality/is not the same as/uses the ! operator



 relational operators-comparing two variables or values/go between pairs of objects/always work in pairs

 the comparison results in true false

 > greater than
 < less than
 >=greater than or equal to
 <=less than or equal to

 logical operators-comparing pairs of true and false/between realational expressions or boolean values/always works in pairs

 the comparison results in true false
 they compare two true or false values
 they compare pairs of relational expressions

 && and -requires both in pair to be true for the whole pair to be true
 || or -requires at least one of the pair to be true for the whole pair to be true
 ! not -flips a value-true becomes false, false becomes true-is not used for comparison-if more than one are true the result is false
 ^ exclusive or (xor)

 ternaries-decision making on one line

 (condition)? do if true : do if false;
